<p><strong><em>subscreen</em></strong>
(<strong><em>sub</em></strong>group <strong><em>screen</em></strong>ing)
package has been developed to systematically analyze data, e.g., from
clinical trials, for subgroup effects and visualize the outcome for all
evaluated subgroups simultaneously. The visualization is done by a shiny
application called Subgroup Explorer. Typically, shiny applications are
hosted on a dedicated shiny server, but due to the sensitivity of
patient data in clinical trials, which are usually protected by informed
consents, the upload of this data to an external server is prohibited.
Therefore, we provide our tool as a stand-alone application that can be
launched from any local machine on which the data is stored.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Identifying outcome relevant subgroups has now become as simple as
possible! The formerly lengthy and tedious search for the needle in a
haystack is replaced by a single, comprehensive and coherent
presentation.</p>
<p>The central result of a subgroup screening is a diagram, in which
each dot stands for a subgroup. The diagram can show thousands of them.
The position of the dot in the diagram is determined by the sample size
of the subgroup and the statistical measure of the treatment effect in
the respective subgroup. The sample size is shown on the horizontal axis
while the treatment effect is displayed on the vertical axis.
Furthermore, the diagram shows the line of the overall study results.
For small subgroups, which are found on the left side of the plot,
larger random deviations from the mean study effect are expected, while
the deviation from the study mean for larger subgroups tends to be
smaller. Therefore, the dots in the figure are expected to form a funnel
for studies with no conspicuous subgroup effects. Any deviations from
this funnel shape may hint towards conspicuous subgroups.</p>
<div id="chap2">
</div>
<div id="package-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Package Functions</h2>
<p>The subscreen package consists of three major functions:
<code>subscreencalc</code>, <code>subscreenvi</code> and
<code>subscreenshow</code>. The first function generates an object of
class <code>SubScreenResult</code>, which is required for the shiny
application. The second function performs a variable importance
calculation via random forests. This calculation is optional and will
unlock the <em>Variable importance</em>-tab in the Subgroup Explorer.
The third function starts the shiny application Subgroup Explorer. In
the recent version of the app, subscreenshow can be accessed without
data. In this case, demo data can be selected in the ‘upload data’-tab.
To upload own data, either the SubScreenResult object is called in
subscreenshow or in the Upload Page the SubScreenResult object is
uploaded. In the next sections, all three functions are explained in
more detail.</p>
<div id="chap21">

<div id="subscreencalc-input" class="section level3">
<h3>2.1 <code>subscreencalc</code> Input</h3>
The function <code>subscreencalc</code> returns a list object of class
<code>SubScreenResult</code>. This list object contains all subgroup
information required in the shiny application. All function parameters
are explained in detail in the subsections of this chapter.The following
table gives an overview of all parameters which can be adjusted:
<pre>
<b>data               </b> data frame with study data
<b>eval_function      </b> name of the evaluation function for data analysis
<b>subjectid          </b> character of variable name in data that contains the subject identifier, defaults to &#39;subjid&#39;
<b>factors            </b> character vector containing the names of variables that define the subgroups (required)
<b>max_comb           </b> maximum number of factor combination levels to define subgroups, defaults to 3
<b>nkernel            </b> number of kernels for parallelization (defaults to 1)
<b>par_functions      </b> character vector of names of functions used in eval_function to be exported
                      to cluster (needed only if nkernel &gt; 1)
<b>verbose            </b> logical value to switch on/off output of computational information (defaults to TRUE)
<b>factorial          </b> logical value to switch on/off calculation of factorial contexts (defaults to FALSE)
<b>use_complement     </b> logical value to switch on/off calculation of complement subgroups (defaults to FALSE)
</pre>
<div id="chap211">

<div id="data" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.1. data</h4>
The input data frame should have one row per
subject/patient/observation. The following columns are required:
<ol>
<li>
treatment/group/reference variable (only if comparison will be
performed)
</li>
<li>
subgroup factors, i.e. categorized baseline/demographic variables
</li>
<li>
variable(s) needed to derive the endpoint/outcome/target variable(s)
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, the data set could include the following columns from
the example data set:</p>

</table>
<p>where sex, ageg, albuming and cholg are the categorized factor
variables and event.pfs and timepfs are the variables used to derive the
endpoint via the eval_function (in this example the hazard ratio).</p>
<div id="chap212">
</div>
<div id="eval_function" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.2. eval_function</h4>
<p>The input function eval_function() needs to be defined by the user.
This function calculates the endpoint(s) for each subgroup, e.g. number,
rate, mean, odds ratio, hazard ratio, confidence limit, p-value, … The
results have to be returned as a numerical vector. Each element of the
vector represents an endpoint (outcome/treatment effect/result).</p>
In our example, we calculate the hazard ratio for progression free
survival:
<pre>
hazardratio &lt;- function(D) {

 HRpfs &lt;- tryCatch(exp(coxph(Surv(D$timepfs, D$event.pfs) ~ D$trt )$coefficients[[1]]),
  warning=function(w) {NA})
 HRpfs &lt;- 1/HRpfs
 HR.pfs &lt;- round(HRpfs, 2)
 HR.pfs[HR.pfs &gt; 10]      &lt;- 10
 HR.pfs[HR.pfs &lt; 0.00001] &lt;- 0.00001
 data.frame( HR.pfs)
}
</pre>
<p>which will add a target variable column named
<code>HR.pfs</code>.</p>
<div id="chap213">
</div>
<div id="factors" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.3. factors</h4>
<p>The parameter <code>factors</code> requires a vector containing the
names of all variables that define the subgroups. In the example above
<code>factors = c(&#39;sex&#39;,&#39;ageg&#39;,&#39;phosg&#39;,&#39;albuming&#39;,...)</code>.</p>
<div id="chap214">
</div>
<div id="max_comb" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.4. max_comb</h4>
<p>This parameter determines the maximum number of factor combination
levels to define subgroups. The default is 3. All combinations between 1
and max_comb will be calculated automatically. With
<code>max_comb = 3</code> a subgroup could be defined for example as
male participant with low age and high albumin values. A high value of
max_comb could lead to small or empty combinations of subgroups, which
are hard to interpret. So, values of higher than 5 are not recommended.
If the maximum number of combination is bigger than the number of
factors, then the number of factors is used as value for max_comb. In
this case a note will be returned.</p>
<div id="chap215">
</div>
<div id="nkernel" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.5. nkernel</h4>
To reduce the calculation time, the parameter nkernel can be increased.
To use multiple kernels the package parallel needs to be installed. If
nkernel &gt; 1 is used, please make sure to use the parameter
<code>par_functions</code> for all functions within the eval function
(see next chapter).
<div id="chap216">
</div>
<div id="par_functions" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.6. par_functions</h4>
This parameter is only required when multiple kernels are used. It
requires the name(s) of functions used in eval_function to be exported
to the cluster. In the example, the hazardratio function (see 2.1.2)
uses the functions <code>coxph</code> and <code>Surv</code>from the
survival package. Therefore these functions need to be specified in the
parameter <code>par_functions = c(&#39;coxph&#39;,&#39;Surv&#39;)</code>. Otherwise an
error appears: Error in checkForRemoteErrors(val) : 4 nodes produced
errors; first error: could not find function ‘coxph’.
<div id="chap217">
</div>
<div id="verbose" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.7. verbose</h4>
<p>A text of the computational information can be returned with
<code>verbose = TRUE</code>. Otherwise verbose should be set to FALSE.
The returned text gives information about the start and end time of
calculation as well the calculation time of the several steps within the
function. Furthermore, the number of subjects, number of subgroup
factors, and number of subgroups are returned.</p>
<div id="chap218">
</div>
<div id="factorial" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.8. factorial</h4>
<p>If (factorial=TRUE) the calculation of factorial contexts is
performed, which is required for the ASMUS-tab (see chapter 3.5). The
calculation time of subscreencalc increases if the parameter factorial
is set to TRUE. A factorial context is defined as the combination of all
factor levels of a given subgroup. As an example, for a subgroup with
three factor combination sex: f, ageg: High and cholg: Low (all factor
variables with 2 levels) the factorial context includes eight subgroups.
The concept of factorial contexts will be explained in more detail in
<a href="#chap351"> chapter 3.5.1</a>.</p>
<div id="chap219">
</div>
<div id="use_complement" class="section level4">
<h4>2.1.9. use_complement</h4>
<p>To activate the complement-calculation of a subgroup the parameter
use_complement has to be set to TRUE. Since the complement of subgroups
with more than one factor level is not necessarily a subgroup as well,
the calculation of the complement needs to be activated, if the
complements are to be included.</p>
<div id="chap22">

</div>
</div>
<div id="subscreencalc-output" class="section level3">
<h3>2.2 <code>subscreencalc</code> Output</h3>
<p>The calculation performed via subscreencalc returns a list object of
class <code>SubScreenResult</code>. The following list entries are
generated in subscreencalc: sge, max_comb, min_comb, subjectid, factors,
results_total.</p>
The main result data set is saved in the sge (short for Subgroup
Explorer) entry. This can, for example, have the following structure:
<table>
<tr>
<th>
SGID

<th>
nfactors

</table>
<p>where every subgroup gets its own subgroup id (column SGID). Also,
the number of factor levels in this subgroup is shown in the column
nfactors. If a factor variable is not used in the subgroup definition,
the specific column entry is coded with ‘Not used’. If the factorial
context calculation is activated, a column FCID_all is generated in
addition, where subgroups related to the same context are condensed.
Since for every target variable the factorial context is checked for
completeness and pseudo completeness, three columns for every target
variable are created and saved in results$sge. In the example of hazard
ratio of progression free survival (HR.pfs), the columns
FCID_complete_HR.pfs, FCID_incomplete_HR.pfs and FCID_pseudo_HR.pfs are
generated. If the parameter use_complement is set to TRUE, the column
Complement_HR.pfs is also available in the results data set.</p>
<p>The other list entries (max_comb, min_comb, subjectid, treat, and
factors) include the parameter values given in the function call.</p>
<p>The list entry results_total includes the overall results of all
subjects. So in the example above, we get the entry
results$results_total:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>
HR.pfs
</th>
<th>
N.of.subjects
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>
1.11
</th>
<th>
312
</th>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The SubScreenResult object returned by subsreencalc is used as input
for subscreenshow (see <a href="#chap23">chapter 2.3.</a>)</p>
<div id="chap23">

</div>
<div id="subscreenvi" class="section level3">
<h3>2.3 <code>subscreenvi</code></h3>
<p>The function subscreenvi performs a variable importance calculation
via random forests using the package ranger. The values returned
describe the variability of variable importance between treatments. High
variability between treatments implies that a subgroup might be more
relevant, because the treatment seems to have an influence on how
important the variable is for modelling. Low variability implies less
relevance as the subgroup is equally important in all treatments.</p>
The following function parameters can be adjusted:

<h2>3. Subgroup Explorer</h2>
<p>To start the subgroup screening via the Subgroup Explorer
application, the subscreenshow-function is used (see also previous
subchapter 2.3). The application itself consists of five main tabs:
Upload, Explorer, Comparer, Mosaic and ASMUS (Automatic/Advanced
Screening of one- or Multi-factorial Subgroups). Each tab will be
explained in more detail in the next subchapters.</p>
<div id="upload" class="section level4">
<h4>3.1 Upload</h4>
<div id="chap31">

<p>If the data parameter scresults in subscreenshow(scresults = NULL) is
null or not specified, the app starts on the upload page. On the upload
page a demo data set or a already saved SubScreenResult object (.RData
file) can be selected. If a saved result data set should be loaded, the
file can selected via the ‘Browse…’-button and the ‘Upload data’-button.
For the demo data set the ‘demo data’ box has to be checked and
submitted via the ‘Use demo data’-button. After a data set is selected,
the data set information and some checks appear on the right side of the
screen. After clicking the ‘Upload data’-button all other tabs are
unlocked and the Explorer-tab appears.</p>
<p>If the SubScreenResult object is already entered via the ‘scresults’
parameter in subscreenshow, the app starts directly on the Explorer
page. In this case a third input mode called ‘Uploaded data via function
call’ appears on the upload page. Since it is possible to use different
data sets in the same session, you can use this option the re-upload the
data set used in the original function call or just to see the data set
information.</p>
<p>Since the factorial context calculation changed due to recent
versions, the check for ‘context calculation performed’ also includes a
check for the newest package version. For older versions features like
the ASMUS-tab are no longer supported.</p>
</div>
<div id="explorer" class="section level4">
<h4>3.2 Explorer</h4>
<div id="chap32">
<p>The Explorer-tab is the main part of the Subgroup Explorer. The
explanation will be divided into four parts (diagram, lists, interaction
plot and options).</p>
<div id="chap321">

<div id="diagram" class="section level5">
<h5>3.2.1 Diagram</h5>
<p>The central part of the Subgroup Explorer is the diagram in the
middle, in which each single dot stands for a subgroup. The diagram may
show thousands of them. The position of the dot in the diagram is
determined by the sample size of the subgroup (displayed on the
horizontal axis) and the statistical measure of the treatment effect
(vertical axis) in that subgroup. Furthermore, the diagram shows the
line of the overall study results. For small subgroups, which are found
on the left side of the plot, larger random deviations from the mean
study effect are expected, while for larger subgroups on the right side,
only small deviations from the study mean can be expected to be chance
findings. So, for a study with no conspicuous subgroup effects, the dots
in the figure are expected to form a kind of funnel. Any deviations from
this funnel shape hint to conspicuous subgroups.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the subgroup screening does not only
consider subgroups, which are defined by one single factor, e.g., sex or
age-group. The strength of the Subgroup Explorer is that it considers
combinations, e.g., ‘old’ men from Europe or ‘young’ Asian women. It is
possible to analyze all combinations of two factors, three factors, four
factors, etc. Typically it make sense to limit this to a maximum of five
factors, since combinations of more than five factors define subgroups
which are often empty, extremely small in size, or difficult to
interpret.</p>
<p>By clicking on a single dot, a subgroup is selected and appears in
red. If multiple points are close to each other, a small area around the
mouse click is detected and a list of selected subgroups appears. In
here one specific subgroup can be selected and apperas in red. For all
points an information box can be shown by using mouse hover.</p>
<p>By selecting a subgroup several lists, which include more information
about the selected subgroup, appear below the plot.</p>
<p>An interaction plot appears on the right side of the main plot, if a
subgroup has a complete (or pseudo-complete) factorial context. For more
details about the concept of a factorial context see chapter 3.5.1.</p>
<p>Several options for the appearance of the diagram are available and
explained in chapter 3.2.4.</p>
<div id="chap322">

</div>
<div id="lists" class="section level5">
<h5>3.2.2 Lists</h5>
<p>By clicking on a dot, at the bottom a table will be displayed under
the tab called ‘Selected Subgroup’ listing the selected subgroup. The
second tab, called ‘Filtered Subgroups’, lists all subgroups which are
chosen by the drop-down combo-box filtered subgroups in the menu on the
left side of the graph. Under the tab ‘Parent subgroups’ the list of all
subgroups with one number of factor combination less than the selected
subgroup appear. For example if the subgroup with 2 subgroup defining
factors ageg: Low and phosg: Low, is selected, the parent subgroups are
the two 1-factorial subgroups ageg:Low and phosg:Low. This allows the
comparison with the parent subgroup as a reference. The Factorial
Context and the subgroup complement for selected subgroups are displayed
as well in seperated tabs.</p>
<p>To save/memorize a subgroup the ‘Memorize’-button in the table of the
‘Selected Subgroups’-tab can be used. All memorized subgroups appear in
green in the Subgroup Explorer graph. With the switch button above the
list of memorized subgroups the label of the memorized subgroups can be
in or excluded in the graph. By switching this button to on, the
subgroup information for all saved subgroups are drawn into the diagram.
Since their might be a space limitation for the information texts for
too many subgroups, it could help to increase the axes sizes via
‘Display Options’.</p>
<div id="chap323">

</div>
<div id="interaction-plot" class="section level5">
<h5>3.2.3 Interaction Plot</h5>
<p>On the right side of the Explorer tab an intercation plot can be
displayed. Per default the plot is collapsed. To use it the user needs
to click on ‘Interaction Plot’ and then select a subgroup. The
interaction can only be displayed for subgroups with an at least pseudo
factorial context.If a complete or pseudo complete subgroup is selected,
the interaction plot panel opens automatically. Furthermore is the
interaction plot is only available for subgroups with 1 to 3 subgroup
defining factors. The vertical axis of the interaction plot can be
synchronized with the diagram (default) or automatically fitted to the
values of the context.</p>
<div id="chap324">

</div>
<div id="options" class="section level5">
<h5>3.2.4 Options</h5>
<p>There are several display options within the Explorer tab, which are
categorized in the four party ‘Variable options’, ‘Importance Tab’,
‘Display options’, Colour options’.</p>
<p>The drop-down combo boxes in the Variable options allow switching
between different target variables (y-axis), changing the reference
variable (x-axis, in general the number of subjects/observations), or
selecting a specific subgroup factor and a corresponding value to be
highlighted in the plot (‘Subgroup Filter’). Which level of detail with
regard to the subgroup factor combinations should be displayed can be
chosen via the ‘Subgroup level(s)’-slider. The maximum of this slider
can be changed with the parameter <code>max_comb</code> in
<code>subscreencalc()</code>. The brightness of the gray dots
corresponds to the number of factors in the graph. Dots with more
factors are brighter than those with less factors.</p>
<p>It is also possible to change the limits of the axes and if possible
(only if all values of the target variable are positive) change the
y-axis to logarithmic scale.</p>
<p>All options are provided with small help texts, which can be shown by
hovering the question mark symbol next to them.</p>
<p>Within the Display options the user can change dot size and
click/select radius. The dot size can be changed to be related to the
number of subjects for each subgroup. The colour brigthness is also
adjustable.</p>
<p>A high amount of colors can be individualized by the user. Beside the
dot colors the overall app appearance can be changed to a
‘print’-version where the background appears in light gray.</p>
<div id="chap33">

</div>
</div>
<div id="comparer" class="section level4">
<h4>3.3 Comparer</h4>
<p>The next tab is similar to the Explorer tab, but allows the quick
comparison between two endpoints. By selecting two target variables two
diagrams appear on top of each other. By clicking a subgroup the same
subgroup is displayed in both plots. With this approach all conspicuous
subgroups in one endpoint can easily be be checked for another endpoint.
It is also possible to display two target variables directly against
each other via the integrated ‘Bubble plot’. The information about the
number of subjects is then displayed through the subgroup size.
Subgroups which are conspicuous in both target variables then shown up
in the corners, while unconspicuous subgroups appear in the middle of
the graph.</p>
<div id="chap34">

</div>
<div id="mosaic" class="section level4">
<h4>3.4 Mosaic</h4>
<p>For an easy visualization about the contingency tables of subgroup
sizes and their target variable values, the display of a mosaic plot can
be beneficial. The user can select up to 3 factor variables, different
target variables for the mosaic display. By using the mouse hover the
user can get more information about the subgroups.</p>
<div id="chap35">

</div>
<div id="asmus" class="section level4">
<h4>3.5 ASMUS</h4>
<p>ASMUS is a feature which guides the user of the Subgroup Explorer
through the screening of tens of thousand of subgroups with the aim to
find those which are worth pursuing. The key of ASMUS is to focus on
assessable subgroups only. This reduces the number of subgroups to be
considered drastically. A fuzzy logic approach is used to select
subgroups which have a remarkable treatment effect and which provide
reliably information. An expert in pharmacology can then decide whether
the subgroup defining factors explain the treatment effect
reasonably.</p>
The challenge to the user has been to find subgroups which are worth
pursuing. There was no feature, which guided the user through the
process of finding worth pursuing subgroups. The newly implemented
feature ASMUS helps to find all worth pursuing subgroups
semi-automatically. Subgroup analyses are performed to assess the
heterogeneity of treatment effects across different groups of patients.
There are always subgroups with a treatment effect which differs from
the study treatment effect. The fundamental question is whether this
observed treatment effect is reproducible or an incidental finding. This
is a matter of the causal influence of the subgroup-defining factors.
Theoretical knowledge or experience can provide evidence. Ultimately,
only another clinical trial can answer the question. This is neither a
matter of the size of the treatment effect nor the number of patients in
the subgroup. Consequently, statistical tests cannot answer the
question. Screening a data set from a clinical trial can only mean to
identify subgroups that are worth pursuing in terms of reproducibility.
A subgroup is worth pursuing if and only if
<ul>
<li>
it is assessable,
</li>
<li>
its treatment effect is remarkable,
</li>
<li>
the provided information is reliable
</li>
<li>
its subgroup-defining factors explain the treatment effect reasonably.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The assessability of a subgroup is indispensable in a subgroup
analysis.<br />
If a subgroup is not assessable, its discovery is not helpful, no matter
how big the treatment effect and how big the subgroup is. Hence, ASMUS
considers only those subgroups as worth pursuing which are assessable. A
subgroup is assessable iff it has good references for comparison. A
subgroup is a good reference for another subgroup if and only if it
belongs to the same factorial context.</p>
<div id="chap351">
<div id="factorial-context" class="section level5">
<h5>3.5.1 Factorial Context</h5>
For a given subgroup, the factor level combinations of the subgroup
defining factor(s) are the factorial context of that subgroup. A
factorial context is complete if
<ul>
<li>
all its subgroups exist in the data set and they
</li>
<li>
all have a non-missing treatment-effect.
</li>
</ul>
In all other cases the factorial context is incomplete. If a factorial
context is complete, then its subgroups are assessable. An incomplete
factorial context causes problems, since the treatment effect for a
subgroup is not evaluable if we can not see whether its value is driven
one specific factor or the interaction of two or more factors. To allow
a more flexible definition on completeness of factorial contexts, we
call/define an incomplete factorial context as pseudo-complete, if the
following criterion are met:
<ul>
<li>
the factorial context would be complete by removing one single level in
one factor
</li>
<li>
we have at least a multi-factorial context (two or more factors)
</li>
<li>
the factor in which the level is removed contains at least 3 levels.
</li>
</ul>
The following tables provide examples of the different
completeness-definitions for a factorial context with two factors (sex
and age group). <br> Complete:

<p>Table 3.5.1.3 Incomplete factorial context with factors sex and
age.</p>
<p>This question whether a subgroup is remarkable can only be answered
for the drug currently under development and in comparison to the study
treatment effect. Medical knowledge is needed to answer the question.
Although the size of the treatment effect of a given subgroup does not
say anything about the reproducibility, it makes sense to include it
into the screening strategy since finding a reproducible but neglectable
treatment effect is not useful. To identify remarkable treatment effects
it is difficult to define a crisp cut point between the remarkable and
the non-remarkable treatment effect. It is much easier to define two
numbers, rem1 and rem2, such that treatment effects less than a are
truly not remarkable greater than rem2 are truly remarkable between rem1
and rem2 are remarkable with a certain degree of truth. ASMUS is based
on this fuzzy logic approach utilizing a linear truth-function. The
provided information is reliable when the sizes of the subgroups of a
factorial context play an important role, but this is not the only
criterion. The relation of the treatment group sizes within the
subgroups play role as well. A big subgroup with drastically imbalanced
treatment groups may not considered to provide less reliable information
than a smaller subgroup with nearly balanced treatment groups. However,
ASMUS is based on the size of subgroups only for simplicity reasons.
Although the reliability of information does not say anything about the
reproducibility of the treatment effect it makes sense to include it
into the screening strategy. Even if a treatment effect is remarkable
and the subgroup-defining factors explain the treatment effect
reasonably the subgroup is not worth pursuing because the reliability of
the provided information is poor. Again it is difficult to define a
crisp cut point between subgroup sizes sufficiently big to provide
reliable information and those which do not. It is much easier to define
two numbers, rel1 and rel2, such that subgroup sizes less than rel1 are
truly too small greater than rel2 are truly big enough between rel1 and
rel2 are big enough with a certain degree of truth.</p>
<p>The truth value for the remarkability of the treatment effect and the
truth value for the reliability of the provided information are combined
with a logical “and”. From the many proposal, which can be found in the
literature, to calculate a logical “and” in fuzzy logic (minimum,
algebraic product, drastic product, etc. ), we selected the algebraic
product because it is simple and convex. The convexity is appreciated
because a lower truth-value for the remarkability requires a
compensation with a higher truth-value for the reliability and vice
versa. The central question is when do the subgroup-defining factors
explain the treatment effect reasonably. It can only be answered by
experts in pharmacology.</p>
<p>So in ASMUS, the user selects whether the assessability is based on
the complete factorial context only or complete and pseudo-complete
factorial contexts. The user also specifies the numbers a and b for the
remarkability and the reliability criterion. For a given subgroup it is
determined if it is assessable.<br />
The truth values for the treatment effect and the size of the subgroup
are calculated and multiplied (algebraic product for a fuzzy logical
“and”). If the subgroup is assessable and the product of the truth
values exceeds a user defined threshold the subgroup is proposed to be
evaluated whether its subgroup defining factors explain the treatment
effect reasonably. The direction of remarkability can be changed via
tickbox. The multiplicity value requires a value between 0 and 1 and
influence the steepness and shape of the curve. When all settings have
been made, the number of subgroups which are remarkable and reliable
regarding the selection are displayed and the ‘Continue’-button appears
in green.</p>
<p>After clicking continue, the second page of ASMUS opens where the
remarkable and reliable subgroups can be analysed in more detail.</p>
<!-- subscreen (Subgroup Screening) has been developed to sysematically analyze data, e.g., from clinical trial, for subgroup effects and visualize the outcome for all evaluated subgroups simultanously. -->
<!-- The visualization is done by a shiny application. Typically Shiny applications are hosted on a dedicated shiny server, but due to the sensitivity of patient data in clinical trials, which are usually protected by informed consents, the upload of this data to an external server is prohibited. Therefore we provide our tool as a stand-alone application that can be launched from any local machine on which the data is stored.  -->
<!-- # Description -->
<!-- Identifying outcome relevant subgroups has now become as simple as possible! The formerly lengthy and tedious search for the needle in a haystack will be replaced by a single, comprehensive and coherent presentation. -->
<!-- The central result of a subgroup screening is a diagram in which each single dot stands for a subgroup. The diagram may show thousands of them. The position of the dot in the diagram is determined by the sample size of the subgroup and the statistical measure of the treatment effect in that subgroup. The sample size is shown on the horizontal axis while the treatment effect is displayed on the vertical axis. Furthermore, the diagram shows the line of no effect and the overall study results. For small subgroups, which are found on the left side of the plot, larger random deviations from the mean study effect are expected, while for larger subgroups only small deviations from the study mean can be expected to be chance findings. -->
<!-- So for a study with no conspicuous subgroup effects, the dots in the figure are expected to form a kind of funnel. Any deviations from this funnel shape hint to conspicuous subgroups. -->
<!-- # Functionality -->
<!-- Every subgroup is represented by a single dot in the plot.  Subgroups may be defined by a single factor (e.g. sex=female) or by a combination  of different factors (e.g. agegroup=young AND smoker=no AND right-handed=yes). Which level of detail with regard to subgroup factors should be displayed  can be chosen using the slider input on the left. -->
<!-- The drop-down combo boxes allow for switching between different endpoint (y-axis),  changing the reference variable (x-axis, in general the number of subjects/observations), or selecting a specific subgroub factor and a corresponding value to be highlighted in the plot. The one-level subgroup will be the most right dot. -->
<!-- Also all combination will be highlighted. Combinations will be shown left from this dot. The plot type can be switched between linear (standard) and logarithmic. The range of the y-axis to be displayed can be reduced to zoom in. -->
<!-- Clicking on a dot will lead to a table display at the bottom listing all subgroups in that area (tab 'Selected Subgroups'). In a second tab ('Filtered Subgroups') subgroups chosen by the drop-down combo box will be listed. -->
<!-- # Input Data (for subsreencalc) -->
<!-- The input data frame should have one row per subject/patient/observation. -->
<!-- As columns the following are required -->
<!--   1. variable(s) needed to derive the endpoint/outcome/target variable(s)  -->
<!--   2. treatment/group/reference variable (only if comparison will be performed) -->
<!--   3. subgroup factors, i.e. categorized baseline/demographic variables -->
<!-- The input function eval-funtion() needs to be defined by the user. -->
<!-- This function will calculate the endpoint(s) for each subgroup,  -->
<!-- e.g. number, rate, mean, odds ratio, hazard ratio, confidence limit, p-value, ... -->
<!-- The results will be returned as a numerical vector. Each element of the vector represents  -->
<!-- an endpoint (outcome/treatment effect/result). -->
<!-- The output object of subsreencalc will be the input for subscreenshow. -->
<!-- # Things to consider -->
<!-- There should be no 'NA' values in the input data set. If there are values 'NA' consider replacing them by 'No data' or a certain value. The eval-function() should include exception handling for functions that require  a certain input to assure a valid return value (NA is also valid). For example the coxph() function should only be executed if there is at least one observation in each treatment arm (see example). This can be achieved by using trycatch() or a condition. Otherwise the program will abort with error.  -->
